 headphones can provide quite a bit of passive noise isolation, but when you want to really shut the world out, you can activate active noise-canceling technology with the flip of a switch. This filters out ambient sound so you can truly be alone with your music, even in public. Even better, the W828NB's ANC technology works when wired. Use the included AUX cable when battery life is low and still enjoy noise cancelation. it can be used both wired and wirelessly. When used wirelessly, the W828NB headphones receive music streamed from your mobile devices via Bluetooth 5.0 technology. On a full charge, you can enjoy literal all-day audio with up to 25 hours of playback with ANC turned on.
